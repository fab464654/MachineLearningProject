Title: 
Implementation and comparison of different Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to classify 6 classes of images


----------------

This repository contains the implementation of 
- 2 Machine Learning algorithm (SVM & KNN) 
- 2 Deep Learning neural networks (ResNet18 & VGG16)
- A "mixed" pipeline in which a ResNet18 was used as a feature extractor and then the SVM and KNN algorithms were applied to look for improvements

to perform image classification of a Nature Scenes Dataset.
